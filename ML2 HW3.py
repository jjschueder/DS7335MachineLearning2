# Decision Making With Matrices
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import rankdata
# This is a pretty simple assignment.  You will do something you do everyday, but 
#today it will be with matrix manipulations. 

# The problem is: you and your work friends are trying to decide where to go for lunch. 
#You have to pick a restaurant thatâ€™s best for everyone.  Then you should decided if you should split into two groups so everyone is happier.  

# Despite the simplicity of the process you will need to make decisions
#regarding how to process the data.
  
# This process was thoroughly investigated in the operation research community.  This approach can prove helpful on any number of decision making problems that are currently not leveraging machine learning.  

# You asked your 10 work friends to answer a survey. They gave you back the following 
#dictionary object.
